app.js-all the connection to server and connection to db is there
index.js- endpoint 
validators - all the validations are checked and is followed by controller
controller - all the main function is there in controller which is followed by services in which all the db queries are there.

index.js -> validators ->controller -> services

in this API we used transactions here ,because if admin deletes one category and it is unable to delete all the records , so it will rollback all the queries executed, in order to check weather all the products are deleted or neither of them is deleted.

we can run our project by pm2(process manager) or directly node app.js
